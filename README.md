Fuzzball MUCK
=============

Fuzzball is a [MUCK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUCK) server, an online text-based multi-user chat and roleplaying game.  Multiple people may join, set up characters, talk, and interact, exploring and building a common world.  Nearly every aspect of the game can be customized via [MPI-driven descriptions](https://www.fuzzball.org/docs/mpihelp.html) and [MUF programs](https://www.fuzzball.org/docs/mufman.html).
