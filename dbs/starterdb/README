* The database contains two players, One and Keeper. You should change One's
  password immediately:

    connect #1 potrzebie
    @password potrzebie=<some new password>

  Only One can perform some functions like setting and removing players'
  Wizard flags. Keep its password safe!

  Keeper is for owning general MUCK property such as MUF programs and public
  areas. Programs that need a "force wizard" can use Keeper. Feel free to
  rename Keeper with your MUCK's name or initials.

* There are three environment rooms for public building:

    $env/null    Null Environment Room
    $env/in      Indoor Environment Room
    $env/out     Outdoor Environment Room

  By default new rooms are placed in the Null Environment Room.

* Some commands in this database to which you may not be accustomed are:

    alias        Set an alias, like a page #alias, to be used in page,
                 whisper, laston, meetme, etc.
    ansi         Shows an ANSI test pattern; "ansi #on" enables color.
    away         Set an "away" flag that's shown in page, ws, and WHO.
    banish       Allows a room owner to ban players from a room or area.
    feel;taste   Sense verbs like "smell".
    ignore       Operates Fuzzball 6's inserver "ignore" function.
    @muf         Runs short MUF programs, like @mpi.
    programs     Searches for MUF programs set Viewable.

  Use "<command> #help" to get documentation on any of them. To use alias and
  away in your own MUF programs, "@view $lib/alias" and "@view $lib/away".
  "@view $lib/table" for another unusual library, for tabular output, as in
  ws, wd, and laston.
